            <p class="custom2-text">ABOUT ME<br>Growing up, I was always fascinated by puzzles and riddles, which eventually led me to discover my passion for software development. I have been coding for a couple of years now and have gained a wealth of experience and honed my skills in the process. My curious and creative nature has driven me to continuously push the limits of what I can do with my coding abilities.
                <br>
                In addition to my love for coding, I also enjoy playing basketball and keeping active. Basketball provides a much-needed physical release from the mental exertion of coding, and helps me maintain both physical and mental fitness. Music is also a major part of my life, and I love to play the guitar as a source of joy and fulfillment. Whether itâ€™s for myself or for others, playing the guitar and listening to music is a form of relaxation and release for me.
                <br>
                My love for technology and my desire to constantly improve and streamline my life has led me to explore the world of home automation. I've automated everything in my room, from the lighting to the network connection, in order to make my life easier and more efficient. With my skills in software development, I've been able to design and create custom applications that control these systems and make my life more convenient.
                <br>
                In conclusion, I am a driven individual who is always seeking new challenges and opportunities to expand my knowledge and abilities. Whether it's through coding, playing basketball, playing music, or exploring new technologies, I am constantly striving to better myself and find new ways to make my life more fulfilling.</p>
