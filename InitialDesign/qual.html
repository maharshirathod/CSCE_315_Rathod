          <h4>About Me</h4>
          <h5>Growing up, I was always drawn to riddles and puzzles, and my passion for problem-solving led me to a future in software development. As a curious person, I have always been eager to try new things and explore new avenues. My love for coding is paralleled only by my love for music. I have been playing the guitar for as long as I can remember and music has always been a huge part of my life. I also love playing sports, and basketball is one of my favorite activities. Whether I am on the court or in front of my computer, I am always pushing myself to be better and to take on new challenges.
            <br>
            Recently, I had the opportunity to put my skills to the test during an internship at Marathon Petroleum, where I learned the importance of teamwork and adapting to different work environments. I was responsible for a project that required me to work with a team of people from different backgrounds and skill sets. I quickly learned the value of communication, collaboration, and adaptability, and I was able to apply these skills to help my team achieve success.
            <br>
            In addition to my love for coding, music, and sports, I have also been a founding member of a company that deals in imported Faux Mink Lashes. Our aim is to enter the ecommerce beauty sector with affordable, high-quality products. Balancing business management, client relations, and academics requires detail-oriented time management skills, which I have honed over the years. I also administer the cloud-based systems for company logistics, finance, and operations, ensuring the smooth running of the business and contributing to its growth.
            <br>
            Overall, I am a well-rounded individual who is always eager to take on new challenges and learn new things. Whether I am solving complex coding problems, playing the guitar, or helping to grow a successful business, I am always striving to be the best that I can be.</h5>

        <p class="custom5-text"> My expertise in domain administration led to a 15% improvement in Sarbanes-Oxley 
          walkthrough turnover during an enterprise-level management change analysis. I audited financial 
          controls for the merger of the two largest refineries in the U.S. and collaborated with senior 
          management to review substantial transactions. My creativity and technical skills shone in a company hackathon, 
          where I designed an app that displayed team and project progress using data from PowerBI and PowerApps, while also 
          incorporating Microsoft single-sign-on for added security.</p>
