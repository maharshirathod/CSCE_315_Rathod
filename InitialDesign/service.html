          <div class="summary-container" style="height:200px; overflow-y:scroll;">
            <p>I've had the privilege of guiding over 300 young people towards a brighter future through weekly classes and 
                organized events. I always strive to share my personal experiences and insights with them to help them grow 
                academically, ethically, personally, and spiritually.
                In addition to this, I have also been passionate about giving back to the community. 
                I have organized successful Walkathons that raised over $100,000 in funds for cancer research and 
                environmental safety. To make this happen, I collaborated with City Hall and BAPS Charities and worked 
                hard to raise funds throughout the greater Houston area. The support and generosity of the community was truly 
                inspiring, and I am proud to have made a positive impact in this way.</p>
